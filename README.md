# AndrewBennettDev dotfiles

### Description
These are very simple dotfiles, mostly for my gitconfig and vimrc. I enjoy swapping Linux distros and setting up new PCs from
time to time and this is a safe way to do that without losing the important info. I don't have too many crazy settings, so this
won't contain any eye openers or hidden secrets!
